Since winter 2019/2020 I have been giving guest lectures on [*Deep Learning and AI*](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/cms/studium_lehre/lehre_master/deep1920/index.html) at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). The topics include
- Math primer and the foundation of neural networks.
- Generative neural networks.
- Uncertainty in deep learning (collaboration with Markus Geipel, Florian BÃ¼ttner and Markus Kaiser).
