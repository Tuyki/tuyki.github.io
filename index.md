I'm a research scientist at [Siemens AG](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html).

I enjoy good movies and series, calligraphy and classical music. Currently I'm
finishing the [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach).


*Sometimes it seems as though each new step towards AI, rather than producing something which everyone agrees is real intelligence, merely reveals what real intelligence is not* -Douglas R. Hofstadter, GEB.
